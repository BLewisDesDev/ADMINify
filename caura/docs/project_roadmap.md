# ADMINify Project Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-26  
**Status**: Planning Complete  
**Purpose**: Strategic development plan for ADMINify modular code library

---

## Executive Summary

ADMINify is a modular code library designed to streamline administrative tasks for Caura (NDIS/aged care services). The project follows a "library-first" approach where each major component operates independently but can be orchestrated for complex workflows.

### **Current State Analysis**

**Functional Components:**
- Document generation system (`doc_gen/`) - Working, needs refactoring
- Government reporting tools (`dex/`) - In development, critical path
- Payment calculation scripts (`scripts/pay_calc/`) - Functional utilities
- Brand assets and website integration - Complete

**Quality Assessment:**
- Scattered codebase with mixed standards
- Functional solutions with implementation details preserved
- Opportunity for significant improvement through standardization
- Strong foundation for modular architecture

- [x] Development standards and code quality guidelines  
- [x] Data protection protocols
- [ ] Refactor `doc_gen/` to new standards
- [ ] Refactor `dex/` auto-reporter to new standards
- [ ] Create template project structure

**Success Criteria:**
- All new code follows established standards
- Critical tools (doc_gen, dex) are reliable and maintainable
- Clear separation between modules

### **Phase 2: Modularization (Weeks 5-8)**

**Goal**: Convert each directory to proper Python project

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `business_reports/` - Standalone reporting module
- [ ] `email_marketing/` - Campaign management tools
- [ ] `scripts/` - Organized utility library
- [ ] Each module has own CLI entry point
- [ ] Standardized testing procedures

**Success Criteria:**
- Each module can be used independently
- Consistent CLI interfaces across modules
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **Phase 3: Integration & Orchestration (Weeks 9-12)**

**Goal**: Create optional coordination layer

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Master CLI for chaining operations
- [ ] Workflow automation scripts
- [ ] Cross-module data exchange standards
- [ ] Integration testing suite

**Success Criteria:**
- Complex workflows can be automated
- Data flows seamlessly between modules
- Robust error recovery across module boundaries

### **Phase 4: Enhancement & Optimization (Weeks 13-16)**

**Goal**: Advanced features and performance optimization

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced error recovery
- [ ] Optional web interface for common tasks
- [ ] Deployment packaging

**Success Criteria:**
- System handles large data volumes efficiently
- User-friendly interfaces for non-technical users
- Easy deployment and maintenance

## Module Development Priorities

### **Critical Path: DEX Reporting**
- **Priority**: Highest (compliance requirement)
- **Dependencies**: Government reporting deadlines
- **Complexity**: High (XML generation, data validation)
- **Timeline**: Phase 1 completion essential

### **High Value: Document Generation**
- **Priority**: High (daily use)
- **Dependencies**: Client data processing
- **Complexity**: Medium (template processing)
- **Timeline**: Phase 1-2

### **Business Intelligence: Reports & Analytics**
- **Priority**: Medium (operational efficiency)
- **Dependencies**: Payment systems integration
- **Complexity**: Medium (data aggregation)
- **Timeline**: Phase 2-3

### **Support Tools: Utilities & Scripts**
- **Priority**: Medium (development efficiency)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Complexity**: Low (reorganization)
- **Timeline**: Phase 2

---

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### **Language Strategy**
- **Python**: Primary language for new development
- **TypeScript**: Keep existing payment calculators, consider Python migration
- **PHP**: Maintenance mode only for WordPress integration
- **Migration Path**: Gradual conversion prioritizing most-used tools

### **Architecture Decisions**

**Module Independence:**
- Each module maintains its own dependencies
- Standard interfaces for data exchange
- Optional central configuration management
- CLI-first design with optional programmatic interfaces

**Data Flow:**
```
External Data → Module Processing → Standardized Output
     ↓              ↓                     ↓
Raw Exports    Validation & Transform   Reports/Documents
ShiftCare      Error Handling & Logging  Compliance Files
Timesheets     Business Logic           Analytics
```

**Error Handling Philosophy:**
- Fail gracefully with detailed logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic recovery where possible
- Comprehensive debugging for developers

## Development Approach

### **Refactoring Strategy**
1. **Analyze existing code** - Understand current functionality
2. **Extract business logic** - Identify core requirements
3. **Plan improved architecture** - Design with standards
4. **Implement incrementally** - Maintain functionality throughout
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure no regression

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Code Review**: Every refactored module against standards
- **Manual Testing**: Comprehensive testing with real data samples
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-module functionality verification
- **Documentation**: Complete usage documentation for each module

### **Risk Management**
- **Data Backup**: All sensitive data properly protected
- **Incremental Deployment**: Gradual rollout to minimize disruption
- **Rollback Plans**: Ability to revert to previous versions
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Regular updates on progress and issues

## Resource Requirements

### **Development Time Allocation**
- **40%** - Refactoring existing code to standards
- **30%** - New feature development and integration
- **20%** - Testing, documentation, and quality assurance
- **10%** - Planning, architecture, and problem-solving

### **Technical Infrastructure**
- **Development Environment**: Python 3.9+, Node.js (for TypeScript)
- **Documentation**: Markdown-based documentation system
- **Version Control**: Git with structured commit messages
- **Testing**: Manual testing with automated CLI tools
